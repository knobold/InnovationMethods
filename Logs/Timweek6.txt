Week 6

Beam Homogenization (group 6)

Last Weeks to dos:
- design a grating for the laser cutter aswell as an engraved noise pattern (overlap with kaveri)
- Do a SLA print (0.1mm grid at highest accuracy would be cool) 



SLA print: (2h)
- somehow only printed half of the gratings
- unable to find sufficient quantities of alcohol to wash the print


Laser cutter (1h)
- Did a couple of engravings on acrylic 3mm and 2mm
- Couldnt get the laser cutter to traverse the outcutting path (even though linewidth was below 0.05mm)


Misc (1h)
-Set up a Git (sync issues, link next week) 
-Adjusted Slobodans experimental setup so that beam is collimated at MLA and well focused on camera sensor


TO DO next week:
-upload files to GIT
-Do farfield measurements of gratings and MLA
-Wash SLA print
-Figure the laser cutting problem out
