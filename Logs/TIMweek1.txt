Build a beam homogenization using (partially) coherent light sources (Group 6)

Week 1

- Definition of challenge and first interaction with mentor (1.5h)
	Main design goal: A forward scattering device that homogenizes beams of multiple laser diodes.
	Brainstormed solutions as part of workshop:
		- rotating diffuser
		- two Micro lenses (too costly)
		- simple set of apertures
		- submersion/use of dispersive liquid/gas
		

- Research (2h)

	- Micro Lens Arrays (MLA)

	- optimal shape of array very dependent on arrangement of diodes
	- Diffusers (Homogenizers)

		- material 3D printable(decent transmission)
			- iridescent Ice
			- clear PETG (https://hackaday.io/project/34274-atltvhead/log/159126-led-diffusion-log)
			
		- maybe 3D print different grating structures
		- rotation?
		
			
		- Rosco 216 Diffusion sheet (https://shop.avantgarde-technik.de/filter-u-farbfolien/farbfilterbogen/171/rosco-e-colour-216-white-diffusion-bogen/sheet)
			!only viable for powers up to 2kW and T<200Â°C!
	- Reflective coating as a wave guide to reduce losses?	

- Compilation of questions for mentor to be forwarded next week (Group Task)(0.5)
	- What are the transmission goals
	- Characteristics of our MLA
		- Fill factor
		- Aberations
		- focal length
	- Is a wave guide desirable?

***To be compiled on thursday***	
	

Main Goals
	- Efficiency (high transmission)
	- cost effectivness
	
	
Todo (Main Tasks next week)
	- gather all the knowledge from individual research
	- send questions to tutor until Monday
