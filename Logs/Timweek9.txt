WEEK 9

Beam Homogenization Group 6


Improved Python script (1h)
	Formating and saving of Plots
	added rudimentary curve fit

LAB (2h)
	more measurements
	fine tuning of setup and swap to a 150mm focusing lens

Evaluation (0.5h)
	evaluted measuremtents with the python script


Designed apertures (1h)
	incl. reasearch on the diffractive effects this will have (still doing it tho)
	two apertures: 9mm and 12 mm square
	mountable on the 30mm thorlabs grid




To Do next week:

Print the apertures
Find a proper curve fit to evaluate the performance
do measurements with the apertures
