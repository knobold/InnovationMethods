Build a beam homogenization using (partially) coherent light sources (Group 6)

Week 1

(Main Tasks last week) check
	- gather all the knowledge from individual research
	- send questions to tutor until Monday




- Communication & setting up first lab date on May 13th 16:00 (0.5h)

- Meeting with Slobodan to discuss further progression (1h)
	- Hes investigating the acceptance angle im doing more research on beam homo

New: 
Light source is going to be fully coherent so we dont need to design a Laserdiode array

- Research on beam homogenization of a coherent light source(1h)
	- a 4F setup should do the trick just as in FOMO theory
	- Industry materials for DOE: Fused Silica, ZnSe, Plastic

- Installed Inventor Professional in order to be ready to design gratings (1h)







To Do (Next week):
- Familiarize with 3D printers and work out the possibilities
	- thickness 
      - linewidth
	- material and their spectral transimissivity
- Make CADs of experimental gratings
