Build a beam homogenization using (partially) coherent light sources (Group 6)

Week 3 

Research, printing and designing CAD file took ~4.5h

To Dos (From last week):
- Familiarize with 3D printers and work out the possibilities
	- thickness  (still more to test)
      - linewidth (still more to test)
	- material and their spectral transimissivity (PLA Check)
- Make CADs of experimental gratings (check) (ipt file attached)

Experimental grating print results (0.2mm step width in cura):
	Dimensions:
	-1mm dia circles printable
	-0.5mm dia circles not printable
	-0.5mm wide gratings are printable 
	-0.25mm gratings are not printable
	-0.25mm high structures are printable
	Structure:
	-circles can be adjacent and defined
	-gratings with 0.5mm steps are probably better option


transmission values (theoreticaly):

	- white ABS 1mm: 25-35% (for 600-1200nm)
	- white PLA 1mm: 35-50% (for 600-1200nm)
	- white PLA 2mm: 25-35% (for 600-1200nm)

maybe real options other than printing a grating with SLA


To Do (next week):
	-meeting with mentor on friday
		-disuss his ideas for grating
		-get a look at optical setup and required size of grating
	-design a first real prototype grating and print with pla crystal clear
