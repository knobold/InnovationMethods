Week 5

Beam Homogenization Group 6


Printed the first usable grating (3h)
- 7 iterations till the print finally worked (see attached picture)
- had to adjust printing speed and z-hop in order to print the rectangular grid


Designed and tried to print 2 additional gratings (2h)
- couldnt print yet since printers were occupied (gcode file is ready)


First Look at SLA printing (0.5h)
- materials (standard white resin and clear resin are of interest) 
- dimensions (0.025mm possible?) 
- downloaded and got familiar with PreForm

Designed Test grid for SLA Printer (0.5h)


To Do next week:
- design a grating for the laser cutter aswell as an engraved noise pattern (overlap with kaveri)
- Do a SLA print (0.1mm grid at highest accuracy would be cool)
