WEEK 8 

Beam Homogenization (Group 6)



SLA (1h)
tried to print 2 more MLAs with various different settings but Resin would stick to the platform..
For my second try nothing got printed at all even tho everything seemed to work. #


Laser cutter (1h)

Since my laser cut gratings all were a little warped I only engraved a grating and then cut it out. 
Decent results


GIT (0.5h)


Python (3h)
Wrote a pyhton script to analyze the intensity distribuation.
Added a plot for angle dependence



Lab (2h)

Took 40 images of different configurations
Still need to evaluate them with the python script



TO DO next week:
Design a Pinhole or a rectangular aperture to be mounted before sensor so we can evaluate that area only and ignore the noise the gratings produce
